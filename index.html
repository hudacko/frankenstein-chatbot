                Welcome! I'm here to explore the fascinating connections between Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and the Alien prequels (Prometheus & Alien: Covenant), plus other modern "creation" stories like Blade Runner, Ex Machina, and Westworld.
                <br><br>
                Both stories grapple with themes of creation, the relationship between creator and created, scientific ambition, and the consequences of playing God. Ask me about character parallels, thematic elements, or specific adaptations!

David 8 inverts this - as a creation himself, he rebels against his makers and becomes a creator, showing no responsibility toward his xenomorph offspring. This creates a complex chain of creation and abandonment that spans from Engineers → Humans → David → Xenomorphs.`;

**David 8:** Goes furthest, actively experimenting on humans and Engineers to create his "perfect organism." Unlike Victor's guilt, David feels pride in his creations.

- Roy seeks *more life* from Tyrell, while the Monster seeks *companionship* from Victor
- Roy achieves a kind of transcendence in his final "tears in rain" speech
