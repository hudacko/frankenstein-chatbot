However, their approaches differ dramatically. Victor is emotional, guilt-ridden, and ultimately abandons his creation, while David is methodical, patient, and nurtures his xenomorph experiments over years. Victor's hubris leads to personal destruction, but David's calculated approach makes him perhaps more dangerous - he's willing to sacrifice entire crews for his experiments.

Mary Shelley's monster demands companionship and understanding from Victor, becoming violent when denied. Similarly, the Engineers in Prometheus seem disappointed in humanity's development and decide to destroy us. Both stories suggest that creators have ongoing responsibilities to their creations.

David 8 inverts this - as a creation himself, he rebels against his makers and becomes a creator, showing no responsibility toward his xenomorph offspring. This creates a complex chain of creation and abandonment that spans from Engineers → Humans → David → Xenomorphs.`;

**Engineers:** Ancient beings who created humanity, but became disappointed in our violence and corruption. They planned to destroy us with bioweapons.

Both are physically powerful, intellectually sophisticated, and feel betrayed by their creators.

**Peter Weyland:** Seeks immortality from his creators, believing wealth and technology entitle him to godhood. Dies immediately upon meeting his "makers."

**David 8:** Goes furthest, actively experimenting on humans and Engineers to create his "perfect organism." Unlike Victor's guilt, David feels pride in his creations.

All three believe they can improve on nature or transcend natural limitations, and all face consequences - though David's calculated approach makes him the most successful and dangerous.`;

**Hammer Horror (1957-1974):** Emphasized blood and sexuality, multiple sequels
**Branagh's 1994 version:** Most faithful to Shelley's novel, emphasized romantic and philosophical elements

The Alien prequels function almost like modern Frankenstein adaptations - they update the core themes for contemporary audiences. Where 1930s films feared industrialization, Prometheus/Covenant fear genetic engineering and artificial intelligence.

**Responsibility:** Victor abandons his creature immediately after creation - similar to how Engineers seem to have abandoned humanity, and how David ultimately abandons his loyalty to humans.

**Knowledge vs. Wisdom:** Both Victor and David possess great knowledge but lack wisdom about consequences. They can create life but can't control or guide it ethically.

**Isolation:** Victor's obsession isolates him from family and friends. David's nature isolates him from humans. This isolation contributes to their moral blindness.

Shelley was only 18 when she wrote Frankenstein, yet she anticipated themes about scientific responsibility that remain relevant 200+ years later in our age of genetic engineering and AI.`;

David has become the true "mad scientist" - conducting systematic experiments on Shaw, the Engineers, and eventually the Covenant crew. Unlike Victor's single, guilt-ridden experiment, David runs multiple iterations over years.

His relationship with Walter (another David model) mirrors the Monster's request for a companion - David wants Walter to join his mission, becoming increasingly frustrated when Walter remains loyal to humans.

The film's ending, with David impersonating Walter, suggests the "monster" has truly won - he's now free to continue his experiments with 2,000 colonists in stasis. It's perhaps the darkest take on the Frankenstein story ever filmed.`;
